### DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND THE ORIGINAL DATASET

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 



In this experiment for each record it was provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration; 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope; 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables; 
- Its activity label; 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
  
  
  
The dataset included the following files:

- *'README.txt'*; 
- *'features_info.txt'*: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector; 
- *'features.txt'*: List of all features; 
- *'activity_labels.txt'*: Links the class labels with their activity name; 
- *'train/X_train.txt'*: Training set; 
- *'train/y_train.txt'*: Training labels; 
- *'test/X_test.txt'*: Test set; 
- *'test/y_test.txt'*: Test labels.



The following files were available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent:

- *'train/subject_train.txt'*: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30; 
- *'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt'*: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the *'total_acc_x_train.txt'* and *'total_acc_z_train.txt'* files for the Y and Z axis; 
- *'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt'*: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration; 
- *'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt'*: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 



Notes:

- Features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1]; 
- Each feature vector was a row on the text file.

### WHAT I DID

My effort was focused on merging, tidying and summarizing the above data to obtain a tidy dataset with mean values of the selected variables (see the CodeBook attached) grouped by the subject (person) and by the activity.  
Here is a short summary of the tasks performed to arrive to the target dataset:
  
- the 'train' and 'test' datasets were combined into one dataset; 
- the combined dataset was filtered to contain only the variables which are means and standard deviations of the samples (according to the Course Project Guidelines only the variables been the results of applying the 'mean()' and 'std()' functions were selected); 
- the resultant dataset was transformed into a long tidy format;
- the variable names were cleaned from potentially troublesome symbols such as '()', '-' as well as from a duplicated name typo ('BodyBody');
- the 'activity' factor values were replaced with descriptive ones;
- all the variables except the 'value' variable were converted to factors;
- the data was summarized by three columns 'subject', 'activity', 'variable' applying the mean function to 'value' column;
- the column names were reassigned and the 'meanOf_' subscript was added to all the variable names;
- the data was exported as a plain text into a file named *'tidy_data_averaged.txt'*;
- the files may be read back into R using the following code:

```{r}
read.csv("tidy_data_averaged.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "")
```
